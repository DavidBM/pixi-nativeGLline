pixi-nativeGLline
=================

A library that uses native GL_LINES for drawing 1px graphics lines in pixi.js.

Why only 1px?
=============
Because browsers can only implement 1px line width with GL_LINES. More information in: [Google groups discussion](https://code.google.com/p/angleproject/issues/detail?id=119)
